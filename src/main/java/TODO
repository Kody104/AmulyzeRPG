(Write as a specific question)

1. How should the program know when the user is USING a CustomItem? 
	Possible solutions:
		1. Upon using the item, check to see if the item is an instanceof a CustomItem. If so, perhaps a uniqueID to identify
		   which item it is.
		2. Create a class for each customItem and have CustomItem have an abstract method 'useItem()'. Each item defines how
		   it can be used.
