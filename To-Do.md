# Classes 
Got to rework roll chances for all classes. Levels and exp and stats all need tweaking. Got to cleanup a lot of messy code and oversights. Lightning (Mage) strikes should be deleted. Hook (Warrior) needs a buff. PlayerDeath should be worked better than it is to include exp and level changes and hp resets. Roll Items in inventory when moved should update to show what they do. Leap (Beserker) needs a buff. Roll items algorithim needs completely redone.
